S => Single Responsibility Principle

As per the single responsibility principle 
    1. A class should have only one reason to change
    2. Which means, every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
    3. OR Each class and module should focus on a single task at a time



In Single Responsibility Principle 
    1. Everything in the class should be related to that single purpose
    2. There can be many members in the class as long as they related to the single responsibility
    3. With SRP, classes become smaller and cleaner
    4. Code is less fragile
