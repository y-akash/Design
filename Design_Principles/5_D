D => Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)


As per the Dependency Inversion Principle
    High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    AND
    Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
    To simplify this we can state that while designing the interaction between a high-level module and a low-level one, 
    the interaction should be thought of as an abstract interaction between them.
